# LangtonsAnt
A simulation of the cellular automata Langton's Ant written in c++ using SFML. 
The rules of the ant are as follows:
At a white square, turn 90° clockwise, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit
At a black square, turn 90° counter-clockwise, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit
Simple rules lead to complex, unexpected behavior.
